# Road to 3D Website

Welcome to the "Road to 3D Website" project! üåêüöÄ In this journey, we will explore the exciting path to mastering the creation of 3D websites using technologies like Three.js and GSAP. This project is built with Next.js, a powerful React framework, to showcase the seamless integration of these technologies into modern web development.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to get the project up and running on your local machine:

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed on your machine:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/)

### Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/road-to-3d-website.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd road-to-3d-website
   ```

3. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

### Running the Project

To start the Next.js development server, run the following command:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Visit [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to see the project in action.

### Turbo Mode

We have included an additional script to enhance the development experience. Run the following command to enable Turbo Mode:

```bash
npm run turbo
```

This script leverages Next.js Turbo to optimize your development server for faster builds.
